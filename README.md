# CH2-CLASS-Pipeline
This pipeline allows the user to download data of class payload of chandrayaan 2 from ISRO's [pradhan](https://pradan.issdc.gov.in/ch2/) website and plot its data(7-16kev) in counts vs time

I have created this pipeline as a part of the data analysis work I was doing wherein I was seeing correlation between Solar energetic protons (SEPs) from GOES data and CLASS data. This [python notebook](https://github.com/Vai838/CH2-CLASS-Pipeline/blob/main/CLASS_Pipeline.ipynb) file just downloads CLASS data and plots its graph. The part for GOES is excluded from this repo. In case anyone is interested in that code, please contact me.
